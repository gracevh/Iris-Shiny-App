# Iris-Shiny-App
Shiny scripts, plotting scripts, things regarding the app...etc. 

The main intention of the project is to get to know some of the functionality of R Shiny and its scripting process. This is my first Shiny app. 

I'd like to extend the project by adding predictive accuracy scores or error rates based on selected variables (more than just two variable option), as well as eventually adding a feature where the user can input variable values for the app to predict the flower species. 

I'd like to do these additions mainly to further understand the R Shiny API.
